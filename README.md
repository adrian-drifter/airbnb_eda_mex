Exploratory analysis on mexico city airbnb data

This repository will perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) as well as a ML model in order to make predictions.

The data has been downloaded from open airbnb datasets, specifically from Mexico City.

It uses the listings.csv which is an integration and sumarization of different tables.

The aim was to create a predictive regression model utilizing scikit learn libraries.
